# Hello There

My intent for this project is to demonstrate my Git/GitHub and Python knowledge. The Python portion of my project is geared toward data analysis.

## My Project 
Future instructions for this project to go here.

I have a great interest and passion for Fantasy Football. I sourced my data from [FantasyDataPros](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/csv_files)

### My Project Features
Below is information on features I selected to met my project requirements:

#### Read Data From an External File
I sourced my data set from FantasyDataPros as noted above. I used the Pandas libary to read in data from a .CSV file, which contained weekly Fantasy Football statics from the 2019 season. In the future I intend to better learn how to use APIs, so that I can source my current data set. An example would be using ESPN.com's API for fantasy football data.

#### Git / GitHub

I continued my utilization of Git and furthered my knowledge on the subject during project. I learned Git terminal command using GitBash. I learned and utilized teriminal commands noted below in the list below. I made commits anytime I made changes and pushed those commits to my GitHub repository. Check out my commit history on this project [Here](https://github.com/dust39/FFL_project_2022/commits/main).
- Git init : to initialize my local repository.
- Git status: to check the status of any file changes in my local repository.
- Git add: to add my changed files to a staging area.
- Git commit: to commit my changed files.
- Git push: to push my local commits up to my GitHub respository.

## Conclusion
Is there ever a conclusion in technology??? I learned so much working on this project. It may seem simple on the surface, but the amount the I have learned is incredible. I loved the challenge and I look forward to continuing my coding adventure. Thank You to Code Kentucky for this opportunity and Thank You for looking at my project!
