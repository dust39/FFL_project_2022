I continued my utilization of Git and furthered my knowledge on the subject during project. I learned Git terminal command using GitBash. I learned and utilized teriminal commands noted below in the list below. I made commits anytime I made changes and pushed those commits to my GitHub repository. Check out my commit history on this project [Here](https://github.com/dust39/FFL_project_2022/commits/main).
